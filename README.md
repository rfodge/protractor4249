Created using the Angular Seed project (https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).

Repo for demonstrating Protractor Issue #4249:

https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/4249


Clone Repo

Run npm install

Run npm start

Run npm run protractor


It will fail, but if you uncomment the rootElement line in the protractor config file the test will then pass.
